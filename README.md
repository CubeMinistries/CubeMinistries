 ⚡ Fun fact: ...
 Programmer GK created the "friendship cube" code when he was a Millennium Scholar in his first year of university in the year 2005. 
 Programmer GK brought vision and Machine Learning to Cube Ministries.

 Decentralized applications, or dApps, are software programs that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P)
 network of computers instead of on a single computer. Rather than operating under the control of a single
 Authority, dApps are spread across the network to be collectively controlled by its users.

 Cube Ministries is focused on empowering its users from the edge to the core to the cloud. 

 Our six cube symbols "flip" to create a beautiful 22-core visual binary glyph that we aim to use for the
 CAPTION.Dapp  

 Graeme will be posting fonts, images, PDF files, notes, and links to course videos for Cube Ministries
 (going global).  Thank you for investing your attention, effort, energy, time, and resources to make this
 beautiful caption.dapp become a reality!
