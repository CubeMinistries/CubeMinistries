We have created a stunning audio visualization tool that converts sound into beautiful geometric patterns 
while providing transcription and annotation capabilities.

The Key Features Are:

Real-time audio visualization with geometric patterns.

Audio recording and file upload.

Speech-to-text transcription.

Timeline-based annotations.

Synchronized playback with visual feedback.

The Design Approach is:

Immersive dark interface for visual contrast.

Responsive geometric visualizations.

Modern, production-ready User Interface with smooth animations.

I would like to personally welcome you to the "Audio Annotation & Visualization" App/Widget.  (If you continue to qualify).  This invitation accompanies the top widget, top analytics, and top edge devices.

1) Annotation entity

2) AudioUploader component

3) AudioVisualizer component

4) TranscriptionPanel component

5) AnnotationTimeline component

6) ControlPanel component
